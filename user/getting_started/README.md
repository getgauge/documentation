# Getting Started

This section will explain the steps needed to get Gauge working.

Gauge is a first class command line tool. This means that you can operate entirely from the command line. Or, if you prefer to use an IDE then Gauge also has excellent integration with multiple IDEs.

The following section describe the steps needed to set up Gauge and get specs working from the command line or [with an IDE](../ide_support/README.md).

###Using Gauge from command line :

* [Downlod and Install](http://getgauge.io/download) Gauge
* Install a Gauge [language plugin](../plugins/installation.md)
* [Create a Gauge project](creating_a_gauge_project.md)
* [Execute](../execution/README.md) the example spec

###Using Gauge with an IDE :

* [Download and install](http://getgauge.io/download) Gauge
* Install a Gauge [language plugin](../plugins/installation.md)
* [Install Gauge IDE plugin](../ide_support.md)
* [Create a Gauge project](../ide_support/features.md) via your IDE


Add more [specifications](../specifications/README.md) and underlying [code implementation](../test_code/README.md) for the steps.

If Gauge is already installed, you can check the current version of gauge and all its plugins by `--version` or `-v` flag.

gauge --version
