## Why Gauge?
------------

The communication breakdowns between Developers and Business Stakeholders is a common risk of software development. Gauge is an advanced automation tool that allows requirements to be written in a way that will be understood by all roles in a project and help bridge the gap.

Some of the **key features** of Gauge that make it stand unique include:

* A rich markup based on [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
* Simple, Flexible and Rich Syntax
* Business Language Tests : Supports the concept of executable documentation
* Consistent Cross Platform/Language Support for writing test code. Currently [supported languages](language_features/README.md).
* Open Source, so it could be shared freely and improved by others as well
* A modular architecture with [plugin](plugins/README.md) support.
* Extensible through [plugins](plugins/README.md) and Hackable
* Supports External Data Sources
* Helps you create Maintainable and Understandable test suites
