These generally occur if step implementation is not found for a particular step.
* Ensure the [step implementation](../language_features/step_implementations.md) for the step has been added.
* The [step_template](../ide_support/features.md#step-name-template) marking the step in code is case sensitive and should match the step usage in the spec file.


### Compatibility errors

* The language plugin installed is not compatible with the gauge version installed.

### Execution Errors
